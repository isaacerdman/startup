# Notes for cs260 Fall 2023

## Setup

### Using Github

 - **Links** - The home page and recipe page link to each other. The image for pizza on the cookbook page also links to the recipe page
 - **Text** - Text input can be given to search for a particular recipe in either the cookbook or the recipe page
 - **Images** - Images added for temporary recipe displays under recipe page
 - **Login** - Input box and submit button for login
